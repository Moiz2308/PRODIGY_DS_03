## Task 3: Building a Decision Tree Classifier

This repository contains my submission for Task 3, where I built a machine learning model to predict customer behavior.

### Task Goal
The goal was to build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a bank's term deposit based on their demographic and marketing campaign data.

### Process
1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:** Loaded the dataset and examined its structure.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Converted categorical text data into a numerical format using one-hot encoding so the model could process it.
3.  **Train-Test Split:** Divided the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to train the model and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
4.  **Model Training:** Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier model on the training data.
5.  **Evaluation:** Tested the model on the test set to measure its performance.

### Result
The trained Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of **88.07%** on the test set, successfully predicting customer subscriptions with high precision.
